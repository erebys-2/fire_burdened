Description:
Fire Burdened is a combat platformer with gameplay emphasis on very short range melee and high maneuverability
built in Python using the Pygame Library.

I have set up infrastructure to build a metroidvania, namely the ability to transition into levels of 
various sizes non-linearly and having multiple transitions per level, however it is unlikely that this game will be 
fully realized into one since my vision for it doesn't require such a large world.

Disclaimer:
This is my first major coding project outside of school assignments so there will be some bad code.
Now and then I go back and try to clean up older code as I learn better coding.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SET UP AND RUNNING GAME: *You should have python and pip already installed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows:
    	1. terminal: "pip install pygame-ce"
	2. cd to fire_burdened folder
	3. terminal: "python game_window.py"

Mac:
	1. terminal: "pip3 install pygame-ce"
	2. cd to fire_burdened folder
	3. terminal: "python3 game_window.py"

HOW TO PLAY:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Note: The controls can be reconfigured and saved, but the paragraph below still explains
the base mechanics. 

I recommend trying the default settings. The philosophy was to have one
hand deal with purely movement, and the other hand deal with attacks and special moves.
When you have L/R/Roll/Jump all on one hand it makes the player very maneuverable.

The default controls are:
-WAD to move
-I to melee
-O to shoot
-S to roll
-ALT to sprint
-Enter and Escape for textboxes, pausing game, and some UI
-Y to open inventory
-U to use the current item in your selected inventory slot

Jumping:
    Jumping is variable height. Hold the key for longer and you'll jump higher and farther.

Rolling:
    Pressing S will iniate a roll. 
    Stamina will be consumed the longer you roll.
    Rolling can be canceled by:
        -Hitting a wall
        -Jumping
    You do not take damage while in roll animation.

Melee:
    The direction of the melee attack depends on vertical velocity.
    Pressing I while falling will do a downstrike; pressing I while rising will do an upstrike.
    Pressing I while rolling will do a crit.
    Pressing I while holding down the same direction key A or D will increase horizontal distance traveled.
    Melee animation can be canceled 1 frame early by:
        -Jumping (hold jump after pressing I until you jump)
        -Pressing the opposite direction key A or D (hold either keys after pressing I)
        -Rolling
    You can deflect bullets by hitting them back.

Sprint:
    Holding right ALT increases your movement AND animation speed (all your actions will be faster too), 
    but your stamina regeneration rate is significantly lowered.

Shoot: 
    Holding O will deplete some initial stamina then continuously charge up how
    many projectiles you shoot. You shoot when you lift the key.
    (Nerfed because all my test players are cowards)

Escape/Backspace and Enter can be used in the main menu or pause menu for quick navigation.

Taking Damage:
    There is NO contact damage. 
    The current enemies are so simple that there might seem like contact damage since they're coded to deploy
    their attack hitboxes when close to the player. When damaged, their attack hitboxes are removed.

Inventory:
    The game is not paused while your inventory is open, so keep it open at your own peril!

Use Item:
    If you select an inventory slot it will still be selected when your inventory is closed. 
    You can quickly use the item in that slot using this key.

**Note 2: Toggle screen will change your resolution while the game is running; it does not work on Mac or Linux.

Controller Support:

Generic Controller:
You need to run the game with the controller already plugged in. 
The controls sub menu will have changed from displaying key names to button numbers.

Steam Controller:
Steam Controller works so long as you have Steam open. 
On Steam, change the desktop control scheme to set every button to a unique keyboard key, leave the right touch pad as the mouse. 
In the game, the Steam Controller buttons will be recognized as key presses and controls can be assigned and saved.


I recommend D pad for L/R, then melee/roll/jump/use item for the 4 buttons on the right.

Combos work best when you can hold, roll and attack, jump and attack, or any action paired with movement at the same time. 
This might be more difficult on controller.

Note: This file also contains a level editor, it is user hostile.
Keep an eye on the terminal when you run it.
The tiles with numbers are essentially pointers to background art and will
not display if on the main layer. X to show grid, WS to change levels,
AD to move around, L to increment layers.

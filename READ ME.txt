SET UP:

    Download the following if you haven't already:
    1. Python, 
    2. Pygame, 

        To install Pygame I think it was 
        Win + R, type "cmd", enter, then paste: "python3 -m pip install -U pygame"

    3. Visual Studio Code or some other IDE, 

        Download the microsoft python extension, then go into settings and 
	search "Execute in File Dir", set it as enable.

        The second part is important or else the next time 
	you open VS code you will be hit with file not found errors...
        why this is not a default setting eludes me.

	Personally I use VS code with Kevin Rose's python indent extension, 
	VS code for python is unuseable without it.


This zip file has the directories in right places.

To run, open game_window.py and hit the run button in the upper right corner.

The controls are WAD to move, I to melee, O to shoot, S to roll, and ALT to sprint.
The direction of the melee attack depends on if you're falling or rising.
I while falling will do a downstrike, I while rising will do an upstrike.
I while rolling will do a crit.
You can jump and roll in mid air too.

Holding ALT increases your speed, but your stamina regeneration rate is lowered.
Holding O will deplete some initial stamina then continuously charge up how
many projectiles you shoot. You shoot when you lift the key.

Currently you can see how much damage you dealt to enemies on the terminal.

========================================================================================
Note: This file also contains a level editor, it is jank asf.
Keep an eye on the terminal when you run it.
The tiles with numbers are essentially pointers to background art and will
not display if on the main layer. X to show grid, WS to change levels,
AD to move around, L to increment layers.

Also: I started this game by following a youtube tutorial on how to make a platormer game
in pygame by Coding with Russ. Both the core of the game and the level editor probably have
some resemblance, but the code has since deviated. There is some spaghetti in this code.

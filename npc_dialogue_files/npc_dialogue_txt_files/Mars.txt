Mars# Yeah, we're looking for the remains of this place's god to bring back home.# 10# 0
Mars# Where is the god? Well, we gotta look for it. Rumors say it lays deep within the heart of the city. Unfortunately there's more and more 'locals' the deeper you go.# 11# 1
Mars# By the way, we'll be splitting up looking around that way we cover more area.# 8# 0
Mars# This is the holy city of Remgrist. Once upon a time it was a utopia blessed by the local god. I guess the people must've done something horrible to recieve a calamity of this scale.# 13# 0
Mars# Readings of the local magical intensity have been steadily declining before the calamity event, and by now it's almost flat-lined.# 8# 1
Mars# We're from lands under the Flame Bearers' rule. You could say they're like a guild or nation we're all born into.# 15# 1
Mars# Nevertheless, they trusted us with a mission of great importance.# 8# 0
Mars# The stuff that enemies drop is strongly infused with magic. By itself it's not that useful, but in the right hands its magic can be extracted and repurposed. I can trade you some goods for it.# 17# 0

Mars# You must've hit your head real hard if you forgot about magic.# 20# 3
Mars# Give me your hands... hmm... Looks like you have some pretty standard abilities. You have good maneuverability and hit heavy, but you're not really suited for close combat.# 0# 0
Mars# Rolling is really useful! You can evade danger or get a little movement boost by rolling. Rolling into a wall won't hurt you, but if you keep doing it... well you know.# 0# 0
Mars# Thanks for your business!!# 8# 0
